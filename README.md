# Hollywood-Most-Profitable-stories

Using the Holywood movies dataset, I have explored Hollywood movies' most profitable stories.

I used Rstudio Program to check, analyse, remove and drop the missing values in the data set to export a clean CSV file to create a dashboard for data visualisation using PowerBI

I made a dashboard analysing the following:
1. The average Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each genre​
2. The number of movies produced per year ​
3. The audience score for each film  ​
4. The profitability per studio ​
5. The worldwide gross per genre
6. Profitability by genre per year
7. Profitability of films per year
